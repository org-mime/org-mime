This program sends HTML email using Org-mode HTML export.

This approximates a WYSiWYG HTML mail editor from within Emacs, and can be useful for sending tables, fontified source code, and inline images in email.

Tested on Emacs 25.1, 26.1, 27

* Setup
#+begin_src elisp
(require 'org-mime)
;; for gnus – this is set by default
(setq org-mime-library 'mml)
;; OR for Wanderlust (WL)
;; (setq org-mime-library 'semi)
;; OR for VM – not yet supported
;; (setq org-mime-library 'vm)
#+end_src
* Usage
** =M-x org-mime-htmlize=
Run =M-x org-mime-htmlize= from within a mail composition buffer to export either the entire buffer or just the active region to html, and embed the results into the buffer as a text/html mime section.

Export a portion of an email body composed using =mml-mode= to html using =org-mode=.  If called with an active region only export that region, otherwise export the entire body.

Warning: There has been some concern voiced over the potential complexity of email resulting from calling this function on an active region resulting in multiple =multipart/alternative= sections in the same email. Please see [[http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/23617][this email thread]] for a discussion of the potential pitfalls of this approach. Speaking from personal experience this has not been a problem for the author.

You could use =org-mime-edit-mail-in-org-mode= edit mail in a special editor with =org-mode=.

After =org-mime-htmlize=, you can always run =org-mime-revert-to-plain-text-mail= restore the original plain text mail.
** =M-x org-mime-org-buffer-htmlize=
=org-mime-org-buffer-htmlize= can be called from within an Org-mode buffer to export either the whole buffer or the narrowed subtree or active region to HTML, and open a new email buffer including the resulting HTML content as an embedded mime section.

Export the current org-mode buffer to HTML using =org-export-as-html= and package the results into an email handling with appropriate MIME encoding.

The following key bindings are suggested, which bind the C-c M-o key sequence to the appropriate org-mime function in both email and Org-mode buffers,
#+begin_src elisp
(add-hook 'message-mode-hook
          (lambda ()
            (local-set-key (kbd "C-c M-o") 'org-mime-htmlize)))
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook
          (lambda ()
            (local-set-key (kbd "C-c M-o") 'org-mime-org-buffer-htmlize)))
#+end_src

** =M-x org-mime-org-subtree-htmlize=
=org-mime-org-subtree-htmlize= is similar to =org-mime-org-buffer-htmlize=
but works on subtree. It can also read subtree properties MAIL_SUBJECT,
MAIL_TO, MAIL_CC, and MAIL_BCC. Here is the sample of subtree:
#+begin_example
 * mail one
  :PROPERTIES:
  :MAIL_SUBJECT: mail title
  :MAIL_TO: person1@gmail.com
  :MAIL_CC: person2@gmail.com
  :MAIL_BCC: person3@gmail.com
  :END:
 some text here ...
#+end_example
* Tips
** Embed image into mail body
Use below syntax,
#+begin_example
[[/full/path/to/your.jpg]]
#+end_example
** CSS style customization
Email clients will often strip all global CSS from email messages. In the case of web-based email readers this is essential in order to protect the CSS of the containing web site. To ensure that your CSS styles are rendered correctly they must be included in the actual body of the elements to which they apply.

The =org-mime-html-hook= allows for the insertion of these important CSS elements into the resulting HTML before mime encoding. The following are some possible uses of this hook.

For those who use color themes with Dark backgrounds it is useful to set a dark background for all exported code blocks and example regions. This can be accomplished with the following,

#+begin_src elisp
(add-hook 'org-mime-html-hook
          (lambda ()
            (org-mime-change-element-style
             "pre" (format "color: %s; background-color: %s; padding: 0.5em;"
                           "#E6E1DC" "#232323"))))

;; the following can be used to nicely offset block quotes in email bodies
(add-hook 'org-mime-html-hook
          (lambda ()
            (org-mime-change-element-style
             "blockquote" "border-left: 2px solid gray; padding-left: 4px;")))
#+end_src

Render text between "@" in red color, you can use =org-mime-html-hook=,
#+begin_src elisp
(add-hook 'org-mime-html-hook
          (lambda ()
            (while (re-search-forward "@\\([^@]*\\)@" nil t)
              (replace-match "<span style=\"color:red\">\\1</span>"))))
#+end_src
For other customization options see the org-mime customization group.
** Beautify quoted mail when replying
It already works out of box. Currently it emulate Gmail's style. You can go back the old Gnus style by =(setq org-mime-beautify-quoted-mail nil)=.
** Export options
To avoid exporting TOC, you can setup =org-mime-export-options=,
#+begin_src elisp
(setq org-mime-export-options '(:section-numbers nil
                                :with-author nil
                                :with-toc nil))
#+end_src
Or just setup your export options in org buffer/subtree.

=org-mime-export-options= will override your export options if it's NOT nil.
** Latex export problem
Please double check your org and latex setup. See [[https://github.com/org-mime/org-mime/issues/33]] for technical details.

You can also modify the variable  =org-mime-org-html-with-latex-default=.

** The exported HTML is wrong
Please note this program can only embed exported HTML into mail. Org-mode is responsible for rendering HTML.

One issue of org-mode is [[https://github.com/org-mime/org-mime/issues/38][unwanted numbers in displaymath and equation]].

Thibault Marin provided [[https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-orgmode/2019-11/msg00016.html][a patch to fix the org-mode]].
** Keep gpg signatures outside of multipart
=org-mime-find-html-start= gives user a chance to tweak the region beginning to htmlize,
#+begin_src lisp
(setq org-mime-find-html-start
      (lambda (start)
        (save-excursion
          (goto-char start)
          (search-forward "<#secure method=pgpmime mode=sign>")
          (+ (point) 1))))
#+end_src
** ASCII export options for text/plain
Use =org-mime-export-ascii= to export the org-mode file as ASCII for the
=text/plain= section of the email message. The default is to export the
original unmodified org-mode file.

ASCII export options:
- plain text
    #+begin_src elisp
(setq org-mime-export-ascii 'ascii)
    #+end_src
- latin1
    #+begin_src elisp
(setq org-mime-export-ascii 'latin1)
    #+end_src
- utf-8
    #+begin_src elisp
(setq org-mime-export-ascii 'utf-8)
    #+end_src

** Prompt for confirmation if message has no HTML

If you plan to run =org-mime-htmlize= on all your email, you may want a confirmation if it appears you're sending an email without multipart content. To do this, add a hook to =message-send-hook= to your init file:

#+begin_src elisp
(add-hook 'message-send-hook 'org-mime-confirm-when-no-multipart)
#+end_src
